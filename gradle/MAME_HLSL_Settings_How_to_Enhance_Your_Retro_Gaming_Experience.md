# MAME HLSL Settings: How to Enhance Your Retro Gaming Experience
 
If you are a fan of retro gaming, you might have heard of MAME, a multi-purpose emulation framework that preserves decades of software history[^3^]. MAME allows you to play thousands of classic arcade games on your PC, but sometimes the graphics can look too pixelated or washed out on modern displays. That's where HLSL comes in.

HLSL stands for High-Level Shader Language, and it is a feature that enables you to apply various effects to the emulated games, such as scanlines, bloom, shadow mask, color correction, and more. HLSL can make your games look more authentic and realistic, as if you were playing on a CRT monitor or TV[^2^]. But how do you configure HLSL settings for MAME?
 
In this article, we will show you how to adjust HLSL settings for MAME and compare the results between 1080p and 4K resolutions. We will also give you some tips and tricks to optimize your performance and quality. Let's get started!
 
## How to Enable and Adjust HLSL Settings for MAME
 
Before you can use HLSL, you need to make sure that MAME is using Direct3D as the video output mode. To do this, open your mame.ini file in a text editor (such as Notepad) and look for the following line:
 `video d3d` 
If it says "video opengl" or "video bgfx" instead, change it to "video d3d" and save the file. This will enable Direct3D support for MAME.
 
Next, you need to turn off any extra filtering that might interfere with HLSL output. Look for the following line in your mame.ini file:
 `filter 0` 
If it says "filter 1" instead, change it to "filter 0" and save the file. This will disable bilinear filtering for MAME.
 
Finally, you need to turn on HLSL itself. Look for the following line in your mame.ini file:
 `hlsl_enable 1` 
If it says "hlsl\_enable 0" instead, change it to "hlsl\_enable 1" and save the file. This will enable HLSL effects for MAME.
 
Now that you have enabled HLSL, you can launch MAME and start playing your favorite games. You will notice that the games look different than before, with more contrast, brightness, and sharpness. You can also access the HLSL settings menu by pressing the Tab key on your keyboard and selecting "Slider Controls". Here you can adjust various parameters such as scanline intensity, bloom amount, shadow mask type, color saturation, and more. You can experiment with different values until you find the ones that suit your taste.
 
## How to Compare HLSL Settings Between 1080p and 4K Resolutions
 
One of the advantages of using HLSL is that it can scale well with different resolutions. Whether you are playing on a 1080p monitor or a 4K TV, HLSL can make your games look crisp and clear. However, there are some differences between how HLSL settings affect 1080p and 4K resolutions.
 
For example, if you are using a high scanline intensity value on a 1080p monitor, you might see some aliasing or jagged edges on the scanlines. This is because the scanlines are too thin for the low resolution. On a 4K monitor, however, the scanlines will look smoother and more natural because they have more pixels to work with.
 
Another example is the bloom effect. If you are using a high bloom amount value on a 1080p monitor, you might see some haloing or ghosting around bright objects. This is because the bloom effect is too strong for the low resolution. On a 4K monitor, however, the bloom effect will look more subtle and realistic because it has more pixels to blend with.
 
Therefore, when comparing HLSL settings between 1080p and 4K resolutions, you might need to adjust some values accordingly. For example, you might want to lower the scanline intensity value or increase the bloom amount value when switching
