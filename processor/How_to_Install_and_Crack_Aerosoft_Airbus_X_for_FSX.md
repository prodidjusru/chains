## Aerosoft Airbus X Features
 
Aerosoft Airbus X is not just a simple add-on that adds some new models to your FSX hangar. It is a comprehensive package that includes many features that are normally costly add-ons. Here are some of the main features of Aerosoft Airbus X:

- Virtual Cockpit: The fully functional Virtual Cockpit puts you in an immersive environment where detailed animations (all with sound effects) and a high level of detailed modelling show the level of detail that separates FSX from FS2004. All the displays are detailed and easy to read, even at lower resolutions, and show how most A320/A321s are now leaving the factory. You can also switch between different views and zoom levels with ease.
- Fly-By-Wire: The Fly-By-Wire flight model is totally reliable and extremely close to the actual aircraft, with the Airbus's realistic FADEC system meaning you almost never have to touch the throttle after you have started your take-off run. The flight model also simulates the effects of wind, turbulence, and ground friction. The Fly-By-Wire system also protects you from exceeding the flight envelope and provides smooth and stable flight controls.
- MCDU: The MCDU (Multifunction Control Display Unit) is the heart of the Airbus's navigation and flight management system. It allows you to enter and modify flight plans, performance data, fuel predictions, and more. The MCDU in Airbus X is probably one of the most advanced and user-friendly ones available for FSX. It includes features such as SIDs and STARs, airways, holdings, direct-to waypoints, vertical navigation, and more. You can also use the Aerosoft Airbus X Application to import flight plans from other sources.
- Systems: While leaving out the most complex (and least used) functions of the computer systems, the actual operation of the aircraft is highly accurate and as easy and logical as Airbus designs its aircraft. The displays will automatically show you the information you most need at any given moment. You can also control systems such as a full automatic/manual air conditioning system, advanced pressurization control, and multiple ELAC, FAC and SEC computers.
- Sound: Aerosoft Airbus X features a high-definition sound-set with over 100 custom sounds for the Virtual Cockpit. You can hear every switch, knob, lever, and button in the cockpit, as well as realistic engine sounds, wind noise, landing gear sounds, and more. The sound-set also includes voice announcements from the cabin crew and ATC chatter.
- Lighting: Aerosoft Airbus X features an advanced ânon-standardâ lighting system, designed to illuminate surrounding scenery. The lighting system includes realistic strobe lights, landing lights, taxi lights, wing lights, logo lights, cockpit lights, cabin lights, and more. The lighting system also adapts to different weather conditions and time of day.
- Airbus X Application: The Airbus X Application is a handy tool that provides take-off calculations, includes a load manager, and allows live flight tracking to be enabled using any smart-phone. The take-off calculator allows you to enter various parameters such as runway length, wind speed and direction, temperature, pressure altitude, etc., and get the optimal take-off settings such as V-speeds, flap position, flex temperature, etc. The load manager allows you to adjust the payload and fuel distribution of your aircraft. The live flight tracking feature allows you to use your smart-phone's browser to see your aircraft's position on a map.

These are just some of the main features of Aerosoft Airbus X. There are many more features that you can discover by reading the comprehensive manual or by flying this amazing add-on yourself.
