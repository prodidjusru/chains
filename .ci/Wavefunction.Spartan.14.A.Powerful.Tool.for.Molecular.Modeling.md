Wavefunction Spartan 14 can also act as a computational server for jobs submitted from other Spartan licenses or iSpartan apps on the iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch. This enables users to perform molecular modeling on the go using mobile devices. Wavefunction Spartan 14 can interface with other databases such as the Cambridge Structural Database and the Protein Data Bank, allowing users to retrieve and analyze crystal and protein structures.
 
Wavefunction Spartan 14 is a versatile and powerful tool for molecular modeling that can be used by students, researchers, and educators in various fields of chemistry. It offers a comprehensive set of theoretical models and a user-friendly interface that makes chemistry at your fingertips.
  
Molecular modeling software can be used for various applications in chemistry, such as drug design, material science, bioinformatics, and spectroscopy. Depending on the purpose and the level of accuracy required, different types of molecular modeling methods can be employed, such as molecular mechanics, quantum mechanics, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulations.
 
Drug design is one of the most important applications of molecular modeling software, as it allows researchers to discover new drugs and optimize existing ones. Molecular modeling software can help to identify potential drug targets, screen large libraries of compounds, predict binding affinities and interactions, and design novel molecules with desired properties. Molecular modeling software can also assist in evaluating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs, as well as their toxicity and side effects.
 
Material science is another field that benefits from molecular modeling software, as it enables the design and optimization of new materials with specific functions and properties. Molecular modeling software can help to study the structure and properties of various materials, such as polymers, metals, ceramics, nanomaterials, and biomaterials. Molecular modeling software can also help to simulate the synthesis and processing of materials, as well as their performance and degradation under different conditions.
